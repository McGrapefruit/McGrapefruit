# I dont really know where this is going

Hi. This is my first try in sharing some of the things I worked on.
Most of the topics here are somewhat connected to Obsidian.md




## My background

I am no developer. 
I am a communicator. I help to communicate and aggregate.
I am a studied Psychologist specialized in communication and interaction. 
I am a system thinker and a strong enthusiast of _Quantum Mechanics_.

I believe *Theodor Schulz von Thun* when he says, that in communication one plus one equals three. 
There is always a new part which is created by the two unique identities(systems) when they exchange information. 

Altho Information itself is quantized, one can never know the quality (the benefit, the worth, the impact) of information and what change is created in the receiving system.
