### I dont really know what I am doing here and where this is going yet..

This is a first try in sharing some of the things I worked on.

Most of the topics here on github will probably be somewhat connected to Obsidian.md



I am no developer. 
I am a communicator. I help to communicate and aggregate.
I am a studied Psychologist specialized in communication and interaction â€“ a system thinker and strong enthusiast of _Quantum Mechanics_.

The psychologist *Theodor Schulz von Thun* says, that in communication one plus one equals three. 
There is always a new part which is created by the two unique identities(systems) when they exchange information. 

Altho Information itself is quantized, one can never know the quality (the benefit, the worth, the impact) of information. One can never anticipate in which way the new information will change the receiving system.
